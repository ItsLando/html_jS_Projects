# html_jS_Projects

These are javaScripts practice problems, the ones you interact with are pretty clunky, but they definitely drive home the point. Most of the html documents are only placeholders for the javaScript file. In addition to that, I used the web browsers console to interact with the code. So far, JavaScript has been very fun to learn, I'm excited to work with it more in the future, but this is what I've been practicing.

for_loops.js and loops.js:

very straightforward practice problems, each loop is suppose to print all the numbers given ceratin restrictions.

movie.js:

This one was very interesting, because I coded a loop that is suppose to check through data in an array, and then to display that information in the console as a form of user interaction. 

script.js:

This purpose of this code is to take information in by the user and once it's finished asking questions, it display a sort of coherent message through the console.

arrayProblemSet.js:

Several forms of data manipulation and logging it through the console, very straightforward stuff.

toDoList.js:

This is the most interesting thing I've done with javaScript, and that is create a mini to do list. It loops through prompt questions based on what you ask it, the html document gives you one-word instructions that you type in, any information presented through the loop is displayed in the console.
