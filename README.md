# html_jS_Projects

This README will serve as a guide for the reader, in an effort to describe what I learned or was practicing in each excercise. This is not everything I have worked on, as I've been on various code-learning sites and using their text editors or input boxes to practice code. This is however, code that I used to practice concepts as I learned them. Enjoy!

for_loops.js and loops.js:

very straightforward practice problems, each loop is suppose to print all the numbers given ceratin restrictions.

movie.js:

This one was very interesting, because I coded a loop that is suppose to check through data in an array, and then to display that information in the console as a form of user interaction. 

script.js:

This purpose of this code is to take information in by the user and once it's finished asking questions, it display a sort of coherent message through the console.

arrayProblemSet.js:

Several forms of data manipulation and logging it through the console, very straightforward stuff.

toDoList.js:

This is the most interesting thing I've done with javaScript, and that is create a mini to do list. It loops through prompt questions based on what you ask it, the html document gives you one-word instructions that you type in, any information presented through the loop is displayed in the console.
